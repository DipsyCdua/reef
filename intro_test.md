# Shiny App Outline
1. summary/introduction page about our topic
- Tailored to target audience (policy makers?)
- Background information
  - Our goal and project purpose
2. DHW Heat Map of the GBR over time
- FEATURES: year manipulation, GBR sectors
- Additional temperature variables we could map:
- SSTA_mean
3. Visualise ENSO & DHW
- ENSO against years
- Draw a line at +/- 7 to see where the El Nino/La Nina periods were
- For each GBR, DHW from january-december, can toggle year
4. Model ENSO and DHW
- Model ENSO & DHW for each of the GBR sectors
- Possibly make a map where the colour of each sector corresponds to the correlation/model coefficient (darker=ENSO is more correlated with DHW?)
5. Final takeaways & Proposal (?)
